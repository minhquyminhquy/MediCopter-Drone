# MediCopter: DIY Autonomous Drone for Medical Supply Delivery

Welcome to our project! We are Quy, Vinh, and Khoa from Gia Dinh High School, Vietnam. **MediCopter** is an automated drone designed to deliver medical supplies to rural areas. In this documentation, you will find details about our journey in building the drone from scratch, including the code and media. At the end of this document, you can also listen to our presentation.

## Introduction

MediCopter is built around a multicopter frame, various sensors, and a power management system. To achieve autonomous flight, it uses a **Raspberry Pi 4** running Python scripts to maneuver the drone to the desired destination, send GPS data back to the server, and detect obstacles. The flight stability is maintained by the **Pixhawk 2.4.8** flight controller, which uses PID tuning.

### Motivation
In the Mekong Delta, a rural region in southern Vietnam, **44%** of hospitals lack sufficient medical supplies, creating a critical need for on-demand medical delivery. Traditional vehicles like ambulances struggle to reach these areas on time due to poor infrastructure and traffic.

MediCopter addresses this issue by speeding up medical supply transportation with drones. Capable of carrying up to 2kg and reaching a peak speed of 100 km/h, MediCopter can deliver most supplies needed in emergencies.

### Key Features
- **Max Load**: Carries up to 2kg with 3D-printed arms and servos.
- **Autonomous Flight**: Uses GPS for automatic navigation and real-time updates to the server.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Detects obstacles like birds, kites, and buildings using object detection.

## Workflow

The workflow involves 3 main components: **Computer**, **Raspberry Pi**, and **Pixhawk** (Flight Controller).

### Pre-flight
1. **Connection**: Raspberry Pi connects to the computer via Dynamic DNS and SSH.
2. **Command Execution**: Python scripts are executed on the Raspberry Pi through the computer.
3. **Preflight Setup**: Sensor calibration and battery checks are performed.

### Mid-flight
4. **Takeoff**: Raspberry Pi commands the flight controller to spin the propellers.
5. **Flight**: The flight controller adjusts motor speeds to maintain stability.
6. **Navigation**: GPS guides the drone to its destination based on waypoints or manual inputs.
7. **Video Streaming**: Video is streamed from the onboard camera.
8. **Obstacle Detection**: Objects like birds and buildings are detected during flight.

### Landing
9. **Landing**: The flight controller gradually descends and lands the drone safely.

## Further Development

While we successfully implemented object detection, real-time obstacle avoidance remains a key area for improvement. Additionally, we plan to enhance the droneâ€™s range and payload capacity by upgrading its battery and motors.
